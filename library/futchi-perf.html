	<p>A purple and orange poem about the future, one that is warm and exciting like a house show.   The comic has no real throughline or plot, it's fragments from another world, intimate and sweet as a diary entry.  This comic fuels me, it is a small burst of song that reminds you that you can fall in love with a melody. You can, and you should.</p>
