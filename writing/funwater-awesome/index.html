      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>When I was a youth I wrote a zine I was v. proud of and led to a lot of good friends and
      wonderful heartful things in my life.</p>
      <p>The last two issues also came at a time when I was going through a <em>real</em> tough time, but
      didn't realize it.  I also didn't realize this tough time was gonna lead me into  a big ol'
      <em>vaaaaalllley</em> of depression.</p>
      <p>I feel better now, and am a better host to my moods, but I get such mixed emotions when I
      think about Funwater Awesome now.  It is hard to reconcile what I thought Funwater Awesome
      would lead to, versus where it ended up.  I thought it would be my fun written friend that
      follows me through my life, and a way for people to know me without ever meeting me.  It was
      going to be my lifelong magnum opus. Instead, it became a weight on me that I worked hard to
      sabotage at the moment when people were reading it because I didn't like life. So now it feels
      like this cringing reminder of unfulfilled potential and heartbreak.</p>
      <p>But...I still like it!  I wont' ever not be proud of this zine and the world it helped
      introduce me to: the world of punk librarians and diy fests and beautifully supportive zine
      distros and self-publishing your dreams
      into a gift to share with others. I don't want these zines to disappear or live on any other
      site.  So I am archiving them here.</p>
      <p>The first one is now 12 years old, the most recent one is almost 10 years old.  Please read
      them with that distance in mind, and that I was a younger, dumber person who was trying the
      best he could.</p>
      <p>ugh, but also enjoy them and have fun if you want!</p>
