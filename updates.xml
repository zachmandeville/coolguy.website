<!-- OH HEY!  Welcome to the RSS FEED LINK!
=======================
*INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE!*
=======================

This page is if you want to keep up with updates from my website through an RSS feed reader.  
So if you've chosen one you like, you can simply subscribe to my updates by copying the url above and placing it 
in the subscribe box of your reader.  That url again, just for convenience, is https://coolguy.website/updates.xml .

For feed readers, I am using theoldreader.com cos it's simple and easy to set up.  
It does require a login, however, and while free they do push you to get a premium version.

If you'd like a list of other free, open-source readers that can be self-hosted
(meaning you can run the reader on your own server if you'd like), check out this page:

https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted#feed-readers

I think that's  it!  Enjoy!

    <title>New Writing from the Vault!</title>
    <link>https://coolguy.website/writing</link>
    <description>Now that I have new styles for the writing page, I wanted to add a bit more writing to it!  So on Saturday, I added "The Bookshelf", "Clear Skin for an Unclear World", and "Going to the Media Party...".  Check them all out on the Writing page!</description>

    <title>Fancier Styles all around!</title>
    <link>https://coolguy.website/styles/main.css</link>
    <description>This is a bit harder to see, but I started DRASTICALLY updating my CSS.  I want it all to be cleaner and more understandable in the organization.  My hope is to completetly remove the old stylesheet, and have a new stylesheet that is hundreds of lines of less code.  Let's see how it goes!!!</description>

    <title>Updated Writing Page</title>
    <link>https://coolguy.website/writing/</link>
    <description>I've completely overhauled the writing page so that it looks nice with the BIG fonts (i'm super into big fonts now.) It also has a slightly softer background-color (I need to figure out how to make my site not hurt my eyes.)

      Also on Wednesday, I added Productivity Tips from Plant Life to the Rituals page. It's a method I'm exploring to help with my own personal work and intentions.  Take from it what you'd like as you'd like!

    <title>The Future Will Be Technical, an Optimistic Manifesto!</title>
    <link>https://coolguy.website/writing/the-future-will-be-technical/</link>
    <description>
      On Wednesday I put up The Future Will be Technical, a longer essay on the writing page.  It's kind of a manifesto?  Feel like I keep writing manifestos
