Basic Font Information
----- ---- -----------
Interval is a monospaced typeface created during a workshop with Thomas Huot-Marchand. I wanted to question the current use of monospaced characters (without the constraint related to the technique) applying a logic of “double letters” (m = n + n | w = v + v. ..) which I draw on a double-space, creating weird typographical monsters. 

The package currently contains the Regular and Bold weights, which both come in a slanted version.

ChangeLog
