      </div>
      <ul>
	<li class="log-li">Now that I have new styles for the writing page, I wanted to add a bit more writing to it!  So on Saturday, I added &quotThe Bookshelf&quot, &quotClear Skin for an Unclear World&quot, and &quotGoing to the Media Party...&quot.  Check them all out on the <a href="writing/index">Writing page!</a></li>
	<li class="log-li">This is a bit harder to see, but I started DRASTICALLY updating my CSS.  I want it all to be cleaner and more understandable in the organization.  My hope is to completetly remove the old stylesheet, and have a new stylesheet that is hundreds of lines of less code.  Let's see how it goes!!!</li>
	<li class="log-li">On Saturday, I completely overhauled the writing page so that it looks nice with the BIG fonts (i'm super into big fonts now.) It also has a slightly softer background-color (I need to figure out how to make my site not hurt my eyes.)</li>
	<li class="log-li">Also on Wednesday, I added <a href="rituals/productivity-tips-from-plant-life.html">Productivity Tips from Plant Life</a> to the <a href="rituals/index.html">Rituals page.</a>  It's a method I'm exploring to help with my own personal work and intentions.  Take from it what you'd like as you'd like!</li>
	<li class="log-li">On Wednesday I put up <a href="writing/the-future-will-be-technical/">The Future Will be Technical</a>, a longer essay on the writing page.  It's kind of a manifesto?  Feel like I keep writing manifestos</li>
	<li class="log-li">Late Saturday night, I also wrote a new <a
     href="https://coolguy.website/diary.html">diary entry</a> about magic Novembers.  It's got a bunch of mixed metaphors.  Or rather, it's like a mixtape of metaphors.</li>
	<li class="log-li">I finished a book and added it to my <a href="library/index.html">bookshelf</a>, then added short notes for some of the books on the shelf.  This would have been on Saturday night.</li>
	<li class="log-li">On Monday night I added a <a href="links/index.html">links</a> page and some more friends!</li>
	<li class="log-li">In the end of September I added a rituals section, including a ritual I did for enchanting yourself and yr computer.</li>
	<li class="log-li">I removed my dependence on fontlibrary.org.  I depend on no other website now! I also cleaned up a bunch of CSS.  You can tell both because everything runs much <em>faster</em> now</li>
	<li class="log-li">On Wednesday I created this log!</li>
	<li class="log-li">I wrote a new blog post on Tuesday night.  read it <a
     href="https://coolguy.website/diary.html">here</a></li>
	<li class="log-li">I created the <a href=library.html>Library</a> on Monday</li>
