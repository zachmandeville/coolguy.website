1 INT. AMBULANCE, DAY 1
        ARCHIE sits motionless, staring at his dad being kept barely
        alive by paramedics. Rilo Kiley’s "It Just Is" plays softly
        in the background.
                            JUGHEAD (VO)
                  Parents set the tone for a life. If
                  they’re good at it, they set you
                  off thinking that life has
                  structure. That there is an order
                  to things.
2 INT. HOSPITAL, NIGHT 2
        Archie continues sitting motionless as the world moves all
        around him.
                            JUGHEAD (VO)
                  So what happens when the rug gets
                  pulled out from under you? When you
                  find out that nobody is actually in
                  charge of things?
3 EXT. CEMETERY, DAY 3
        The coffin is lowered into the earth as Archie continues
        sitting motionless.
                            JUGHEAD (VO)
                  How do you go from believing in
                  something to knowing that there’s
                  nothing?
        Josie & the Pussycats begin singing "Amazing Grace" as
        Archie gets up and walks away. BETTY, VERONICA, and JUGHEAD
        get up and follow him. Betty grabs his arm.
BETTY
Archie.
                            ARCHIE
                  It was too much out there. Those
                  people didn’t know my dad. They’re
                  just spectators.
                            JUGHEAD
                  Let’s get out of here, then.
                    BETTY
          We can do whatever you want,
          Archie. It’s okay if you want to be
          alone, I get that, but
          don’t...force yourself to be alone.
          We’re here for you, and we love
          you, and we can handle whatever is
          going on inside you right now.
HIRAM LODGE (40s, improbably hot) strolls over.
                    HIRAM
          Ronnie, you’re not leaving yet, are
you?
                    VERONICA
          No, I was just trying to comfort
Archie.
                    HIRAM
          Archie, yes. You have my most
          heartfelt condolences. I knew your
          father in school. I don’t think he
          liked me very much, but I admired
          him. He had a true moral compass.
                    ARCHIE
          Thank you, Mr. Lodge.
                    HIRAM
          Please, call me Hiram. Why don’t
          you come over for dinner tomorrow
          night? Nothing fancy, just family
          dinner.
                    ARCHIE
          I’d like that. If you’ll excuse us.
                    HIRAM
          Of course.
Hiram walks away. Archie and the gang get 3 steps further
away when Cheryl comes up.
                    CHERYL
          Archie. I am so sorry for your
          loss. As a recent inductee into the
          dead daddy club myself, I know a
          little bit what you’re going
          through. It’s a shame your dad’s
          big leathery hog has to rot away in
          the ground, but I’m sure he’s in
          heaven railing angels now. Betty,
          I’ll see you at home.
2.
Cheryl walks off.
VERONICA
          She’ll see you at home?
                    BETTY
          It’s...temporary, I think. She’s
          homeless. We’re...family.
                    VERONICA
          Right, because of Polly and Jason.
                    BETTY
          Yep because of their babies and no
          other reasons.
KEVIN runs up to them. Archie is visibly exhausted.
                    KEVIN
          Hey guys, I just talked to my dad,
          I thought you’d want to know he
          said there’s absolutely no leads at
          all in the case, it’s like the
          shooter vanished into thin air,
          anyways see you at school tomorrow.
Kevin runs off.
                    JUGHEAD
          You’d think after Jason people
          around here would have figured out
          how to be chill about grief.
                    ARCHIE
          I can’t stand it. I know they mean
          well, I really do, but I can’t. I’m
          going home.
                    VERONICA
          Is it okay if we come over a little
later?
                    ARCHIE
          Yeah, I’d like that. Just the gang.
                    BETTY
          Just the gang.
                    JUGHEAD
          Just the gang.
3.
                            REGGIE
                  Yep, just us, the gang.
        Everyone tries not to look at Reggie. About 50 feet away,
        Hiram walks up to ALICE from behind.
                            HIRAM
                  Hello, Alice.
        Alice’s eyes widen in alarm. She regains her composure.
                            ALICE
                  Hiram, hello, nice of them to
                  extend the radius on your anklet
                  for this sad occasion.
                            HIRAM
                  Pleased to say I can roam at my
                  pleasure within the continental
                  United States.
                            ALICE
                  How’d you swing that?
                            HIRAM
                  This great new thing called money,
                  I think it’s here to stay. You look
                  terrific, Alice. We should get
                  lunch.
                            ALICE
                  I mostly eat at work.
                            HIRAM
                  Tomorrow you eat out. My treat.
                  I’ll text you the details.
        He walks away. Alice scowls but in an intrigued way.
4 INT. ARCHIE’S LIVING ROOM 4
        Archie, Betty, Veronica, Jughead, Kevin, and Reggie are all
        eating pizza and drinking Illicit Beers while watching Monk.
                            JUGHEAD
                  That’s what I love about
                  Monk...he’s truly an obsessive
                  compulsive detective.
                            BETTY
                  What a lot of people would see as a
                  handicap, he actually uses...as an
                  advantage.
4.
                    ARCHIE
          I guess we could all stand to be
          more like Monk that way.
They toast.
ALL To Monk!
                    REGGIE
          Yeah Monk is always cleaning his
          hands.
There is a silence thicker than cream.
                    REGGIE (cont’d)
          You guys stoked for school
          tomorrow? I love freakin’ going
          into school. All the lunch ladies
          know me man, I’m a legend when it
          comes to lunch time.
                    JUGHEAD
          Archie, as the newly crowned Prince
          of the Southside Serpents, I
          promise I will do everything I can
          to see that justice is done for
          Fred Andrews. He was a good man.
                    BETTY
          Juggy, I don’t like when you call
          yourself that.
                    JUGHEAD
          It’s not like I’m going to start
          selling dimebags! I’m a decoration
          with a little bit of leverage, like
          Queen Elizabeth.
                    REGGIE
          Yeah, Arch, my man, if I see the
          guy who killed your dad I’ll punch
          him in the frickin’ nuts until they
          explode.
                    VERONICA
          Archie, you want to go...upstairs?
                    ARCHIE
          Sure, yeah, I’m pretty beat. You’re
          all welcome to stay as long as you
          want. My house, my rules, I guess.
          My mom won’t be here for another
          few weeks.
5.
        Archie and Veronica go up the stairs.
5 INT. ARCHIE’S BEDROOM
Veronica lays down seductively on the bed.
                            VERONICA
                  Come here, ginger beef. Let me make
                  you feel better.
                            ARCHIE
                  I can’t do that.
                            VERONICA
                  It’s been days.
                            ARCHIE
                  It’s not that I don’t want to. I
                  do. But...I think us having sex is
                  why my dad is dead.
VERONICA
What?
                            ARCHIE
                  It’s not like i’m, I’m not placing
                  blame, but if I had been home that
                  night he wouldn’t have called me to
                  Pop’s. We wouldn’t have been there.
                            VERONICA
                  What, so my vagina killed your dad?
                            ARCHIE
                  No, no, Ronnie, your vagina is
                  really cool. It’s such a cool
                  vagina. But my big, stinky hog...it
                  doesn’t have the best track record
                  of keeping me out of trouble. I
                  think I just need to be celibate
                  for a while.
VERONICA
Wow.
                            ARCHIE
                  It’s...I just don’t want to keep
                  making everybody’s lives worse
                  because with my huge teen dick.

6.
                            VERONICA
                  It’s not your fault.
                            ARCHIE
                  Hearing that doesn’t change how it
                  feels.
        Veronica sighs. She gets it.
                            ARCHIE (cont’d)
                  I can still snuggle. Snuggling
                  never caused any harm.
                            VERONICA
                  Do you want -
                            ARCHIE
                  - hot cocoa? Well yeah sure, yeah,
                  I guess, if you’re offering, like
                  if it’s something you wanted to do
                  anyways I would drink some.
6 INT. ARCHIE’S LIVING ROOM
                            REGGIE
                  At football practice tomorrow I’m
                  gonna eat a whole pizza in front of
                  everybody so they know I’m really
                  good at eating pizza.
                            JUGHEAD
                  Reggie, I’m gonna put this as
                  delicately as possible on behalf of
                  the room. Nobody cares and we all
                  hate you.
                            REGGIE
                  Whatever, you’re just jealous
                  because I’m part of the gang and
                  you’re not.
JUGHEAD
What?
                            REGGIE
                  I’m always going out to Six Flags
                  and stuff with Archie and Veronica
                  and Betsy and Gay Man and you don’t
                  get invited.
6
7.
                    JUGHEAD
          Did you guys go to Six Flags
without me?
                    BETTY
          No! No, Jughead, we would never.
                    KEVIN
          We know what Six Flags means to
you.
                    BETTY
          Stop trying to stir up drama,
Reggie.
                    REGGIE
          "Stir up drama" huh? I guess I must
          have found THIS in my freakin’
          cauldron!
He pulls out a picture of him, Archie, Betty, Veronica, and
Kevin on a roller coaster.
                    JUGHEAD
          I can’t believe this.
                    BETTY
          It was when you were sick with food
          poisoning! It just happened
          organically, we didn’t plan it!
                    JUGHEAD
          I don’t care if I’m dead, if you go
          to Six Flags, you bring Jug Jug.
                    BETTY
          I know. I’m sorry.
                    REGGIE
          If you got on a roller coaster it
          probably wouldn’t work, because of
          how you are bad to hang out with.
Jughead stares daggers at Reggie. A garden snake slithers
out of Reggie’s shirt.
                    REGGIE (cont’d)
AHHHHHH!
Reggie freaks out and trips and falls into a big old pail of
water.
8.
                            BETTY
                  Looks like you’re all wet, Reggie!
        Reggie scowls. Everybody laughs at Betty’s joke.
                            KEVIN
                  I wonder how that snake got in
                  here.
        Jughead looks in the mirror.
                            JUGHEAD
                  Yeah. How.
7 INT. RIVERDALE HIGH AUDITORIUM 7
        Mr. Weatherbee and Mayor McCoy are holding an assembly.
        Archie shifts uncomfortably in his seat as she speaks.
                            MCCOY
                  Students of Riverdale High, I know
                  that it has been a rough year for
                  us all. Many of you have lost a
                  dear friend, some of you have lost
                  parents. Specifically Cheryl
                  Blossom and Archie Andrews. For
                  those of you who don’t know Archie,
                  he is a beautiful red-haired boy
                  with a strong young body and
                  absolutely no dad at all. That’s
                  why Principal Weatherbee and I have
                  decided to throw a fundraiser
                  concert for Archie and his dead
                  dad. The Fundraiser Concert for
                  Archie and Archie’s Dead Dad will
                  be tonight in the gym and I’m
                  thrilled to announce we were able
                  to book Riverdale’s own Josie and
                  the Pussycats. Thank you, and god
                  bless.
        She leaves. Principal Weatherbee approaches the podium. He
        smiles widely.
                            WEATHERBEE
                  I am the Principal.
        A tiny spider walks up his face, he does not notice.

8 INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY
8
Archie is walking out of the assembly when Moose walks up to
him with full Condolence Face on.
                    MOOSE
          Hey Archie, I just wanted to say, I
          heard about your dad’s heart
          getting blown up at the hamburger
          restaurant, that’s real rough. Are
          you okay?
                    ARCHIE
          I’m fine, Moose. Just grieving.
                    MOOSE
          Wow! I would be doing SO BAD if I
          was you. I would cry all day and
          night and curse that wicked old
          crone God for taking my dad from
          me. See you later I guess.
Moose walks away. Betty, Jughead, and Kevin walk up to
Archie as they all head toward class.
                    JUGHEAD
          You don’t have to go this concert
thing.
                    ARCHIE
          It’s okay. People will expect me
there.
                    BETTY
          Archie they’re just trying to sweep
          this under the rug! Don’t let them
          parade you around like you’re
          mommy’s good boy, wearing the
          little bow-tie she got you and
          nothing else. You shouldn’t tempt
          mother like this. Father will be
          home soon.
                    KEVIN
          Yeah don’t do the thing she said.
ZHANE, a new student, walks over. He is wearing a handsome
vest.
                    ZHANE
          Hey, are you Archie? The guy the
          mayor was pointing at?
10.
Uh, yeah.
ARCHIE
                    ZHANE
          I just wanted to say that was
          messed up, exploiting your private
          grief like that. My name’s Zhane,
          I’m new in town.
                    BETTY
          It’s nice to meet you Zhane, I’m
Betty.
                    ZHANE
          Thank you Betty! I’m new in town, I
          just broke up with my boyfriend and
          I don’t know if I like it here
          sorry I am BABBLING, I always do
          this.
Kevin’s face is a too-friendly mask.
                    JUGHEAD
          Hey, that’s okay! It’s endearing.
          You seem like a very sweet guy. My
          name is Jughead, and this is Kevin.
                    KEVIN
          A pleasure to meet you Zhane. So
          glad there is a...second gay person
          at this school.
                    ZHANE
          Wow, just us?! Small town I guess.
                    KEVIN
          Yes, that is the reason. Small
          minds. Come with me I’ll give you
          the...special gay tour of Riverdale
          High.
                    ZHANE
          Sounds like a blast! See the rest
          of y’all at lunch! I brought
          brownies if you want any.
They walk away.

9 INT. EXTREMELY NICE STUDENT LOUNGE 9
        Archie, Betty, Veronica, Jughead, and Reggie are joshin’
        around teen style on the couches when Kevin comes in, sweaty
        and nervous, wearing Zhane’s vest.
                            KEVIN
                  Zhane wanted me to tell you all
                  that he moved away, to Europe.
                            BETTY
                  Darn! He seemed like such a cool
guy.
                            JUGHEAD
                  Nice vest.
                            KEVIN
                  Oh yes he gave to me his vest, as a
                  trophy. Of friendship!
                            REGGIE
                  Anyways, like I was saying, I
                  actually prefer having diarrhea.
                  It’s easier!
        Jughead smirks and looks at Archie and Betty.
A beat.
          JUGHEAD
Hey Reg...I got you a present.
          REGGIE
A present for me? After how I
treated you?
          REGGIE
I’m glad you finally acknowledge me
          as your alpha.
Jughead hands Reggie a tube of peanut brittle.
                    REGGIE (cont’d)
          Hell yeah bitch, I love nut-based
          confections.
                    JUGHEAD
          I think you’ll be...startled by how
          much you enjoy it.
12.
                            REGGIE
                  Nah I have pretty measured
                  expectations.
        Reggie opens the can up and ka-blam! A bunch of spring
        loaded cloth snakes are unloaded upon him. Reggie flings
        himself off the couch and backs up against the wall. He is
        pale and panting. Everyone points and laughs at Reggie,
        except Betty who is stone-faced.
                            REGGIE (cont’d)
                  I’ll kill you, Jughead!
                            JUGHEAD
                  That’s what happens when you tango
                  with the master of disaster.
        Reggie storms out.
                            BETTY
                  Juggy, a word.
        Betty leads Jughead out by the hand.
                            ARCHIE
                  Do you think she’s going to do some
                  hand stuff to him as a reward for
                  delighting us all with that prank?
VERONICA
Yes.
10 INT. STAIRWELL 10 Jughead is unbuckling his belt.
                            BETTY
                  What are you doing?
                            JUGHEAD
                  Gettin’ ready for hand stuff!
        Betty rebuckles his belt. Jughead is confused.
                            BETTY
                  I’m not rewarding that behavior Jug
                  Jug. I know you’ve made a lot of
                  new...friends, but the halls of
                  Riverdale High are no place for
                  gang warfare!
13.
                            JUGHEAD
                  Reggie stepped to me. And you all -
                  you ALL betrayed me at Six Flags. I
                  restored balance.
                            BETTY
                  He’s just gonna get angrier and
                  come after you harder now! The only
                  way to kill your enemies is to make
                  them your friends Jug.
                            JUGHEAD
                  What about poison
                            BETTY
                  You know what I mean.
                            JUGHEAD
                  You’re one cool customer, Betty
Cooper.
                            BETTY
                  Someone’s gotta keep you in check,
                  Jughead Jones.
        They hug. The shot lingers a while.
                            BETTY
                  So like if you wanted to do hand
                  stuff to me that would be okay
                  actually.
11 INT. OLIVE GARDEN, NOON
Alice walks up to a booth where Hiram is sitting.
                            HIRAM
                  You found the place, I’m glad.
                            ALICE
                  Don’t get mixed up, Hiram. I’m here
                  to interview you. You’re a famous
                  criminal and this is a good career
                  opportunity for me. And I’ve been
                  dying to try Riverdale’s hottest
                  new spaghetti restaurant.

                    HIRAM
Their server, LEANNE, walks up.
Uh huh.
14.
                            LEANNE
                  Hey, welcome to Olive Garden! Can I
                  start you off with some drinks?
                            HIRAM
                  I’ll have a bottle of red wine...
        He slips a 20 into Leanne’s apron.
                            HIRAM (cont’d)
                  Poured into a pitcher of coke.
                            LEANNE
                  Yes, sir! And for you miss?
                            ALICE
                  Chastity water!
LEANNE
What?
                            ALICE
                  Hot water with three lemon peels in
                  it! Chop chop!
12 INT. POP’S
Reggie and DILTON are both eating big hamburgers.
                            REGGIE
                  So then I said actually, I prefer
                  having diarrhea.it’s easier!
                            DILTON
                  Woah and then -
                            REGGIE
                  Yeah, then they all started
                  cheering for me and saying stuff
                  like "Reggie is our dear friend"
                  and "we’re all aware that Reggie’s
                  dad also died recently."
                            DILTON
                  That’s so cool Reggie.
                            REGGIE
                  Dilton do you think Jughead would
                  be mad if I asked his sister
                  Veronica out on a date?
12
15.
                            DILTON
                  I think he would like it, but isn’t
                  she dating the red orphan?
                            REGGIE
                  A valid point from a genius friend.
        They both take huge gulps from their drinks.
                            REGGIE (cont’d)
                  What if I trick her?
                            DILTON
                  Trick her how?
                            REGGIE
                  At the big memorial dance, I could
                  just...do all the stuff from a
                  date, but it would be at public
                  event so if shes like "you are
                  trying to date me" I can be like
                  "you are a crazy woman, I am just
                  having fun in a normal way."
                            DILTON
                  And you called ME a genius! As a
                  long time member of the gang, I
                  fully endorse this romantic scheme.
13 INT. JUGHEAD’S TRAILER

        Jughead walks in and set down his heavy bookbag. He opens an
        incognito tab on his laptop and types in
        "pornhub.com/sapiosexual" when a greasy sack hits his head.
        He slams his laptop shut and turns around to see where the
        hot bag of hamburger sandwiches came from, only to find FP
        standing behind him, notably out of jail.
                            FP
                  Figured you’d be hungry.

          Cheryl! What on Earth!
                    CHERYL
          I’m sorry, I’m sorry I was trying
          to make a big spaghetti dinner to
          thank you and your family for the
          kindness you’ve shown me but I’ve
          never been in a kitchen and don’t
          know what spaghetti is, I just know
          it’s what our servants ate.
                    BETTY
          Trying to make dinner? All you’ve
          made is a big mess!
                    ALICE
          Her heart was in the right place.
Hal and Polly walk in.
                    POLLY
          And so his whole plan was to
          trigger and apocalyptic race war,
          but the twist was he WANTED white
          people to lose.
                    HAL
          That’s wild. Woah, what happened to
          the kitchen?!
                    ALICE
          Cheryl tried to make a spaghetti
          dinner for us all.
                    HAL
          Wow, what she really made was a big
mess.
                    BETTY
          I already let her know.
                    HAL
          Well, say, spaghetti sounds swell,
          and none of us have eaten it today,
          so what’s say we all go to that new
          spaghetti restaurant?
                    ALICE
          Spaghetti... restaurant?

                  I’m going to eat spaghetti and it’s

                  It’s more beautiful than I ever
imagined.
                            CHERYL
                  It’s like a Burger King dressed up
                  as a restaurant for Halloween.
                            POLLY
                  I am also here. A so heavy with-a
                  my little bambinos!!!!
        Leanne, the server from before, walks over. Alice freezes.

                  Table for 5?
                            POLLY
                  7 if you count the spaghetti

                  We do. Come with me.

                  I have never been to this building
                  and I hate spaghetti with my life.
                            LEANNE
                  No, remember? You had a huge spicy
                  pasta lunch? You ordered like nine
                  chastity waters?
                            ALICE
                  Noodles are worms made of bread and
                  the only thing I drink is Sunny D.
                            LEANNE
                  You were eating with a man who
                  smelled like special leather.
        Alice gets up and throws her water in Leanne’s face.
                            ALICE
                  I’m going to go eat dinner
                  somewhere that the wait staff
                  aren’t liars with an agenda, anyone
                  who wants to join me is more than
                  welcome!
        Alice leaves. There is a brief silence.
                            HAL
                  So tell me about this calimari.

17 INT. LODGE APARTMENT
Hermione and Hiram stand in the living room.
                            HERMIONE
                  So what’s your plan?
HIRAM
Plan?
                            HERMIONE
                  Hiram, I’m glad you’re home, and I
                  do care for you, but let’s not
                  pretend being in jail for 3 months
                  fundamentally changed your
                  personality.
                            HIRAM
                  Oh, but it did, mi amor. I’m an
                  honest man now. Plain-spoken.
17
19.
                    HERMIONE
          Honest, you say. How was lunch with
          Alice Cooper?
                    HIRAM
               (performatively unfazed)
          Illuminating.
                    HERMIONE
          Such plain speech.
Veronica and Archie walk in.
                    VERONICA
          Daddykins, mommykins, sorry we’re
          late!
Hermione hugs Archie tight.
                    HERMIONE
          How are you holding up?
                    ARCHIE
          The local news wanted to interview
          me for a segment on the county’s
          hottest mourning teens.
                    VERONICA
          I don’t know if having a number
          painted on his van made that guy
          the news.
                    ARCHIE
          Then what was he, a van racer?!
                    HIRAM
          Archie, have you ever had...beef?
                    ARCHIE
          What? Yes.
                    HIRAM
          Sorry, I’ve been rich so long I
          don’t know which experiences are
          exclusive to me. Tonight we will be
          eating filet super mignon, which is
          a kind of beef you can only buy on
          Millionaire Island.
                    VERONICA
          You went to Millionaire Island
without me?!

                    HIRAM
          I had it shipped, Daddy has to stay
          in the continental United States.
                    VERONICA
          Wow, a landlocked daddy. Things
          have really changed for old
          Veronica Lodge.
SMITHERS runs out of the kitchen wearing a big apron over
his doorman uniform.
                    SMITHERS
          The filet super mignon!
          It’s....burnt!!!
Hiram pours a glass of scotch, drinks it, and then smashes
the glass on his own head.
                    HIRAM
          Do you see my head bleeding,
Smithers?!
                    SMITHERS
          Sir, I’m sorry, I -
                    HIRAM
          DO YOU SEE BLOOD GUSHING DOWN MY
          FOREHEAD, SMITHERS?!
Smithers inspects his forehead.
SMITHERS
          I don’t.
Hiram claps him on the back.
                    HIRAM
               (Jocular in the way only the
               wealthy are)
          That’s because I have a thick skin!
                    SMITHERS
          Very good, sir, very good.
                    HIRAM
          Now leave my fucking house.

18 INT. POP’S
Hermione, Hiram, Veronica, and Archie are eating hamburgers.
                            HERMIONE
                  Is it weird for you, being here?
ARCHIE
Huh?
                            HERMIONE
                  On account of your dad.
                            ARCHIE
                  My father was killed by a lone
                  gunman, not delicious diner fare
                  served at a reasonable price.
                            VERONICA
                  I’m sure Sheriff Keller is hard at
                  work catching your dad’s killer.
                            HIRAM
                  In case you were wondering, I
                  didn’t have your father killed for
                  sleeping with my wife.
VERONICA
What?
                            HIRAM
                  You’re smart kids, smarter than the
                  Sheriff, I’m sure it wasn’t
                  inconceivable to you that a wealthy
                  man with loose morals and a motive
                  might have orchestrated a revenge
                  killing. Do you have any idea how
                  cheap it is to order a hit in
                  Riverdale? I spent more on the
                  filet super mignon.
                            ARCHIE
                  Well, I’m glad you’re being
                  upfront, I guess.
                            HIRAM
                  I thought your father was a good
                  man, Archie, and I liked that he
                  was keeping Hermione company. Are
                  you familiar with cuckoldry?
        Hermione starts chewing really loudly.

                    ARCHIE
          I can’t say that I am sir, is it a
          kind of sport?
                    HIRAM
               (chuckling like Santa Claus)
          I suppose you could call it that!
                    HERMIONE
          Boy, these hamburgers are
          tee-riffic, huh?
                    HIRAM
          Cuckolds like myself, we love
          knowing that our wife is getting
          porked by some other dude. For many
          it’s about being sexually
          humiliated by a superior man. For
          me, I love knowing that a dude
          uglier and poorer than me is
          railing my wife.
                    HERMIONE
          Should we get dessert??
                    HIRAM
          Your father did that for me. And I
          will always be grateful. If there
          is anything - ANYTHING - I can do
          to aid your investigation, I will
          do it. You have my world.
                    ARCHIE
          You’re a good man, Mr. Lodge. Hey
          Veronica, should we get going to
          the big concert?
Archie looks to where Veronica was, she is gone. He looks
over to see she is by the door on the phone. She walks over.
                    VERONICA
          Sorry, I missed everything after my
          dad said he didn’t kill your dad.
                    HIRAM
          I would be happy to summarize.
                    HERMIONE
          Hiram I will bite down on my
          capsule I swear to God.

                  Jughead wants us to come over to
his place.
19 INT. JUGHEAD’S TRAILER 19
        Veronica and Archie walk in to see Betty and FP arm
        wrestling while Jughead claps.
                            ARCHIE
                  You’re out of jail!
        FP gets up and gives Archie a big hug.
                            FP
                  I’m sorry to hear about your old
man.
                            ARCHIE
                  There’s nothing you could have
done.
                            FP
                  Maybe not, but there’s something I
                  can do. I think I know who killed
                  him.

        A Trivago Guy with long white hair work in a bun wearing a
        shapeless orange dress pours a cup of tea and then spills it
        all over herself.

22 INT. JUGHEAD’S TRAILER, AS BEFORE 22
                            ARCHIE
                  You know who killed my dad?
                            FP
                  I have an extremely good hunch.
                  See, the Southside Serpents weren’t
                  always a biker gang. We’re older
                  than this damn town. When this land
                  was first settled, it was by
                  European mystics. They came here in
                  search of a legendary creature,
                  Deus Anguis.
                            BETTY
                  The God Snake.
                            FP
                  You are just whip smart, you know
                  that? The Cult of Deus Anguis
                            (MORE)
25.
                    FP (cont’d)
          thought he slept beneath what we
          now call Sweetwater River. They
          thought worshipping this god snake
          would bring blessings to them,
          which I guess worked okay, there’s
          a town here now. The cult mostly
          died out around the 70s, but
          there’s still a sect of Orthodox
          Serpents. From what I understand,
          they’re know to make...sacrifices
          from time to time.
                    VERONICA
          And you think Fred was one of those
sacrifices.
                    FP
          I know how it sounds, but they’ve
          knocked over diners all over the
          county.
                    BETTY
          It’s worth looking into, but how?
                    FP
          They’re having a ceremony tonight
          under the bridge.
                    JUGHEAD
          I’ll go. I’m the golden boy of the
          Serpents right now.
                    BETTY
          Jughead, no.
                    JUGHEAD
          Fred Andrews did a lot for me. I
          owe him this much. Everybody else
          go to the memorial concert, I’ll do
          this.
                    BETTY
          If you get shot I’m not patching
          you up. That’s not going to be our
          dynamic.
                    JUGHEAD
          Fair enough.
                    VERONICA
          Hey, who bailed you out?
FP laughs as a father does.
26.
                            FP
                  That’s an extremely good question.
23 INT. MOTEL ROOM 23
        Alice and Hiram are just completely railing each other. We
        pan away from this to the closet, which has slats through
        which you can see Hermione drinking a Big Gulp.
24 INT. RIVERDALE HIGH AUDITORIUM 24
        Archie, Veronica, and Betty enter the auditorium, which is
        decorated in huge print outs of Fred’s driver’s license and
        frowny face emojis.
                            ARCHIE
                  I don’t know if I can do this.
                            VERONICA
                  There is no shame - none - in
                  bailing.
        Mayor McCoy and Principal Weatherbee walk up to Archie.
                            MCCOY
                  Mr. Andrews, so glad that
                  Riverdale’s hottest dadless ginger
                  could be here.
        In the background Cheryl crushes a glass in her hand.
                            MCCOY
                  After Josie and the Pussycats
                  perform, we’d like you to go up and
                  say a few words about your dad and
                  how people shouldn’t move away just
                  because of the 300% spike in
                  murder.
                            ARCHIE
                  I don’t feel comfortable doing
                  that.
        Mayor McCoy hugs him.
                            MCCOY
                       (Whispering)
                  If you don’t it’s going to be a
                  400% spike you Carrot Top
                  looking-ass puke.
        The hug breaks.
27.
                            MCCOY (cont’d)
                  I’m sure you’ll make the right
choice.
        Archie walks off, upset. Veronica tries to follow him but he
        shakes his head no.
                            WEATHERBEE
                  I was born from an egg.
25 EXT. UNDER THE BRIDGE 25
        A beautiful dining room table is set up, cloaked figures are
        congregated around it. Jughead approaches.
                            JUGHEAD
                  Hiss it to me, buddies!
        The cloaked figures all turn toward him.
                            CLOAKED FIGURES
                  Hiss it to me my good snake!!!
        Their leader removes their cloak, revealing himself to be
        JOAQUIN, Kevin’s former lover.
                            JOAQUIN
                  So glad you could come, Jughead.
                            JUGHEAD
                  I thought you left town.
                            JOAQUIN
                  I had an objective to complete. It
                  has been completed.
                            JUGHEAD
                  Should I tell Kevin you’re back?
                            JOAQUIN
                  Christ, no.
        The Serpents sit down. Joaquin gestures for Jughead to sit
        at the head of the table.
                            JUGHEAD
                  Oh, gosh. All this for little old
                  me? How’d you even...know I’d be
                  coming?
28.
                            JOAQUIN
                  The God Snake’s hiss can be heard
                  by those who are listening.
26 INT. AUDITORIUM 26 Veronica and Betty are drinking punch.
                            BETTY
                  I feel like we haven’t hung out in
                  weeks. You know, like, hung out
                  properly.
                            VERONICA
                  It’s been weird. We’ve both been
                  living in Weird County, USA.
                            BETTY
                  Uh, yeah....in the township of
                  Weirdstock!!!
                            VERONICA
                  I haven’t even asked if you’ve
                  gotten any CoverGirl brand
                  cosmetics lately.
        Betty takes out a tube of CoverGirl Total Tease Mascara.
                            BETTY
                  Just this fun but flirty mascara.
                  It only retails for $7.94, which is
                  a bargain at twice the price.
                            CHERYL
                  Guess I’ll have to get used to
                  bargains, huh!!!
        Betty and Veronica shriek.
                            CHERYL (cont’d)
                  I was under the table. Father
                  always said I was a good hider.
        Reggie strolls up with a single red rose.
                            REGGIE
                  Ronnie, I was wondering if you’d
like to -
                            VERONICA
                  Go somewhere else? Sure yes yes.
        Veronica jogs away, Reggie follows behind her.
29.
                    CHERYL
          Guess it’s just us Blossoms!
                    BETTY
          I’m a Cooper.
                    CHERYL
          Okay, sure, I’ll be a Cooper too.
          What should we talk about?
          Rationing grain?
                    BETTY
          Cheryl, I’m going to walk away and
          you’re not going to follow. Okay?
Cheryl grabs her.
                    CHERYL
          Please don’t. I know I’m a lot but
          my dad killed my brother and
          himself and I burnt my house down
          and that’s a lot for somebody who
          had a normal childhood but I
          didn’t, I think you can guess
          pretty accurately I had a weird,
          weird childhood and I don’t know
          how to be. I don’t know how you
          talk to someone without it being a
          vaguely sexual power play. I want
          to learn.
                    BETTY
          Okay. What is...one of your
hobbies?
                    CHERYL
          Killing animals!
There is a silence.
                    CHERYL (cont’d)
          Was that the wrong -
                    BETTY
          Me too. I...also kill animals.
                    CHERYL
          Like, birds, squirrels.
                    BETTY
          Yeah, not like, dogs and cats.
30.
                            CHERYL
                  Of COURSE not.
                            BETTY
                  Maybe a raccoon.
                            CHERYL
                  It’s our right as humans.
                            BETTY
                  God gave us animals to murder
                  whenever we want.
                            CHERYL
                       (Tears of joy in her eyes)
                  Yeah he did! God’s the best!
                            BETTY
                  People get so judgy if you tell
them though!
                            CHERYL
                  Well I’ll keep it a secret. We can
                  have lots of secrets, you and me.
27 INT. BACKSTAGE AT THE AUDITORIUM
Josie, Dilton, Moose, and Midge are all hanging out.
                            DILTON
                  Are you nervous, Josie? With the
                  big talent scout out there in the
                  audience?
                            JOSIE
                  I mean yeah, but what about you?
                  You have your early-entrance
                  interview at MIT tomorrow. You
                  should go home!
                            MOOSE
                  Hey, none of us would miss our best
                  friend’s big performance.
                            MIDGE
                  Yeah, it’s been a crazy year for
                  all of us - my dad trying to kill
                  himself...
                            MOOSE
                  Kevin bullying me back into the
closet...

31.
                            DILTON
                  I got addicted to pain killers..
                            JOSIE
                  And I got kidnapped by that duke.
                            MOOSE
                  But we got through it all TOGETHER.
        Principal Weatherbee enters.
                            JOSIE
                  Waldo!
        They group hug Principal Weatherbee.
                            WEATHERBEE
                  I just wanted to say, before your
                  big performance, how proud I am of
                  you - all of you.
        The hug breaks. Weatherbee smiles.
                            WEATHERBEE (cont’d)
                  My dad was a vial of goo they found
                  in an asteroid and my mom was a
                  turtle.
28 INT. RIVERDALE HIGH AUDITORIUM 28
        Reggie has Veronica in a corner. He gives her a cup of
        punch.
                            REGGIE
                  I heard you like juice so here is
some.
                            VERONICA
                  Well, thanks, Reggie.
                            REGGIE
                  Your hair looks really healthy
today.
        He gives her the single red rose. His hand is cut up from
        clutching it.
                            REGGIE (cont’d)
                  This is a kissing vegetable I
                  bought you, it cost a hundred
                  dollars because I’m also rich.
32.
                            VERONICA
                  Is that what you want? To kiss me?
                            REGGIE
                  Little Orphan Manny isn’t doing it.
                  Lips like those aren’t supposed to
                  go unkissed. Nor a neck like that,
                  or breasts for that matter. Every
                  inch of you beckons to any healthy
                  young man, kiss me, take me.
                            VERONICA
                  Wow, Reggie, I didn’t know you had
                  such a poet’s soul.
                            REGGIE
                  You like it? It’s from a porno my
mom wrote.
29 EXT. UNDER THE BRIDGE
29
A hooded waiter sets a plate with a hamburger, french fries,
and a milkshake in front of Jughead.
JUGHEAD
          Yummy!
He starts scarfing down this tall feast.
                    JOAQUIN
          Do you know the truth of the God
          Snake? I know you know OF him, you
          wouldn’t be here if you couldn’t
          hear him hissing.
                    JUGHEAD
               (mouth full)
          Yeah that kooky snake, say, you got
          any olives?
A small platter of olives is set before him.
                    JOAQUIN
          The God Snake is a loving God.
          Beneath the river, he slumbers. We
          make sacrifices in the hope that
          one day, he will wake up and make
          the world right again. He is
          sleeping, and this world is his
          nightmare.
33.
                            JUGHEAD
                  Sacrifices, huh?
                            JOAQUIN
                  Yes. The living avatar of Deus
                  Anguis must consume these
                  sacrifices of food and drink, to
                  gather the strength to swallow the
                  river and wake up God.
        Jughead looks down at his plate. He searches his eyes for
        somebody else, anybody else who is eating. Not a soul. His
        mouth goes slack and his tongue falls out. The tip, ever so
        slightly, is forked.
JOAQUIN (cont’d)
It is such an honor to have you
here.
30 INT. RIVERDALE HIGH AUDITORIUM 30 Mayor McCoy stands on stage.
                            MCCOY
                  And now, the moment you’ve all been
                  waiting for...a solemn tribute to a
                  pillar of the community.
        Josie and the Pussycats come out wearing mourning veils as
        McCoy exits.
                            JOSIE
                       (singing soulfully)
                  It’s been so long since I saw
                  you...and you know when you’re gone
                  there’s nothing that I can do...so
                  come back here and grind up on
                  me...let me back up on you...one
                  last time...
                            PUSSYCATS
                       (singing)
                  Fred Andrews, we’ll never forget
                  you...
31 EXT. UNDER THE BRIDGE 31 Jughead is freaking out.
34.
                            JOAQUIN
                  You’ve always known the truth,
                  Jughead. Serpent born is the good
                  serpent prince, the one who will
                  free us.
                            JUGHEAD
                  Look, I’m a weirdo, okay? I’m not
                  normal. I’m a freakazoid. I’m a
                  thoughtful introvert, sure. I’m a
                  sweet goffik prince, yeah. But the
                  living avatar of an ancient god? Ya
                  GOTTA be kiddin’ me!!
        Joaquin tosses a mouse in the air and Jughead reflexively,
        effortlessly swallows it. He is shocked by his own actions
        and runs off. A cultist rises to chase him but Joaquin holds
        him back.
                            JOAQUIN
                  All of the other avatars refused
                  the call too. We need only wait.
32 INT. RIVERDALE HIGH AUDITORIUM, AS BEFORE 32
                            JOSIE
                       (singing, REALLY bringing it
                       home)
                  Grind up on me
                  one...last...tiiiiime!
        A banner of Fred’s dead body but with his eyes photoshopped
        open and his mouth photoshopped into a smile is unfurled.
        McCoy takes the stage as the Pussycats take a bow and leave.
                            MCCOY
                  What a good town we have, with a
                  band and an arts scene and we’ll
                  build a mall some day. Before we
                  end the festivities tonight, we
                  have one more speaker. Archie
                  Andrews!!!
        Archie walks out. As he enters McCoy hands him a speech
        while making pointed eye contact. He begins reading from it.
                            ARCHIE
                  Riverdale...mama mia what a town,
                  which my dad liked building stuff
                  in, so it would be disrespectful to
                  me, a grieving child to leave just
                  because murder is happening
                  constantly. And - you know what?
35.
        Archie throws the speech into the air.
                            ARCHIE
                  Riverdale is just a town, and it’s
                  where my dad was murdered for no
                  reason. Most of you didn’t know him
                  and I don’t need you to pretend you
                  did. Archie out!
        He runs off stage. Veronica chases after him. Reggie chases
        after her but he trips and falls into a mop bucket. Mayor
        McCoy storms the stage.
                            MCCOY
                  Looks like Reggie’s all wet, folks!
        The entire auditorium erupts into applause.
33 EXT. RIVERDALE HIGH, MORNING 33
        Cheryl and Betty are anxiously watching something just off
        screen when...snap! Their trap worked, they’ve captured a
        pigeon. It’s little legs are broken.
                            CHERYL
                  How many feathers do you think we
                  can get before it dies of fear?
                            BETTY
                  It’s our duty as scientists to find
                  out.
        Cheryl smiles gratefully.
34 INT. RIVERDALE HIGH, HALLWAY 34
        Archie walks in, trying not to be noticed. Dilton points at
        him.
                            DILTON
                  Hey, everybody, look who it is!
                  Archie the cool rebel!
        Everybody applauds him and then disperses. Veronica walks up
        to him.
                            VERONICA
                  Hey, Red. How’s tricks?
36.
                            ARCHIE
                  I know it’s not cool I ran off. I
know.
                            VERONICA
                  You’re going through a lot, and I
                  get it, and I can be patient.
        Reggie walks by with his dick just, bulging through his
        shorts.
                            VERONICA (cont’d)
                  Up to a point. I am in your life
                  now. I’ve planted a flag. So you
                  can open up to me, and let me in,
                  or I’ll have to move on. Mama’s got
                  options...and I’m Mama.
        Archie kisses her.
                            VERONICA (cont’d)
                  That’s a step in the right
direction.
35 INT. STUDENT LOUNGE 35
        Archie, Betty, Jughead, and Veronica are all sitting down
        when Kevin enters, sweaty, panicked, and wearing a fedora.
                            KEVIN
                  Dylan had to move away suddenly but
                  he gave me his hat that’s why I
                  have it he moved to a country with
                  no phones at all.
                            VERONICA
                  Wow, all these kids who keep moving
                  here for one day are so generous.
                            KEVIN
                  Yeah, cool, what’s up, your dad
                  still dead?
                            ARCHIE
Yeah...
                            JUGHEAD
                  I checked into the cult thing,
                  they’re... harmless. Just a bunch
                  of kooks. No way they did anything.
37.
36 INT. RIVERDALE HIGH HALLWAY 36 The gang walks to their next class.
                            FEMALE VOICE (VO)
                  They have to stay in the dark. I
                  know it hurts, I feel for you. I
                  would never have chosen this, but
                  the timetable has accelerated.
37 EXT. RIVERDALE HIGH 37
        The voice, a girl with white hair is talking to a man in a
        hood.
                            WHITE HAIRED GIRL
                  They can’t know anything is amiss.
                  They’ll have to think I’m just
                  plain old Sabrina Spellman...high
                  school sophomore. And you
                  understand your role in all this.
                  You understand why it has to be
                  this way.
        We pan to see from her POV - the man in the hood is Fred
        Andrews. He nods.
                            FRED
                  If anything happens to my boy,
you’re dead.
                            SABRINA
                  If we don’t stop the Rain of Venom,
                  we’re all dead.
        On top of a hill, they are being watched by cloaked figures.
        Joaquin stands, smiling. The cloaked figures take off hoods,
        revealing 8 different Trivago Guys. Joaquin smiles.
END.
